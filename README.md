This repository is created for the Embedded Systems course project in the autumn of 2023. The system developed is a simple game system based on the LCD1602 display. Programming is done using embedded C for the ATmega328P microcontroller. The project includes the following components:

1. Basic Input/Output
2. Interrupt Design
3. Game Content Design
4. Ultrasonic Distance Measurement
5. Serial Communication

Notably, this project does not utilize the Arduino library. A comprehensive report is available for reference.
